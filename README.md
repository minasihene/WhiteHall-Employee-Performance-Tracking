# WhiteHallProject

This repository provides intuitive stored procedures to help company WhiteHall implement an analytics system to tracks performance of salespeople, set sales quota and compensation levels for their employees based on the total amount sold YTD per salesperson per territory.

The management of WhiteHall Company wish to implement an analytics system due to the increasing customer demand. Customers are not satisfied with the inadequacy in getting the required quantities of products from WhiteHall Company due to salespeople's inefficiency to deliver goods.

The management has decided to track sales per salespeople per territory, quantity sold and set performance-based quota and compensations, to determine the salespeople's performance and to hire more workers if need be in order to meet customers' demand.

In order not to impact the performance of WhiteHall Sale and Purchase Management System, data has been extracted into excel sheets to implement the analytics system that addresses the concerns of WhiteHall management.

The budget has been approved by the Management to create an Operational Data Store and analytic environment that address the management concern.
